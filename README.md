## Stranger Things LED Arduino Code


After watching Stranger Things earlier this year, I became obsessed with the lights! I know, I'm two years too late to the game, but better late than never! I set these lights up for a Halloween party this year and they were a big hit. I spent too much time on them to take them off my wall at this point, so they will be up for a while. 

I watched a couple of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Jydc-EVPM) of people programming their own lights and even found a super helpful [instructional online.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Stranger-Things-Lights/)

The supplies I bought and used are listed below. The overall cost was a little bit more than I intended to spend (~$100) but it was all worth it! 

  * Lights
  * Arduino
  * Power Supplies


I had never used an Arduino before and still fairly new to coding, but with a little research and reviewing other Arduino codes, it wasn't too difficult to catch on. For this code to work and to reference good Arduino code, you'll have to download FastLED's GitHub repo that have really cool patterns. My code is a hybrid of FastLED's "DemoReel", a bit of the code from setups I found online and code that I wrote.   



## Additional Notes:
  *The RGB colors are in the order of GRB in the code
  *To create new spelled words, copy/paste the word functions at the bottom and add a new if statement to the STRANGE function.
  * The time spacing between the words is about five minutes
